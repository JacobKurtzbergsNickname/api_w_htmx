# Jet-Gophering

Thank you ChatGPT for the image.

I started this project on the tails of Tiago's mini-project showing how good the http standard library is and that frameworks aren't strictly necessary in Go.

I didn't want to have another dead repo, so I decided to build it out a bit. 
I used Jet for templating, which is working out well so for. 

Next steps:
Adding HTMX for interactivity, maybe some JS, if I need it. :)
